# Configurations

This repo contains my configurations for terminal and editors.

I use `oh-my-zsh` as my default terminal along with `tmux`.

I mainly use Neovim as my editor for Rust especially for small and medium size projects, therefore, a lot of the configurations in `init.vim` will be related to Rust development. For Neovim, I use `vim-plug` as my plugin manager and `coc.nvim` as my extenstion manager.

I will try to keep this repo as documented as possible.
